We need to
Start by working with a one lined file and then move to a multi lined file.
We need to make sure that the flow of the program is correct and that the functions are working as expected.
Then we can move to the next step - working with a multi lined file.

/*
The pre assembler algorithm will work as follows:
1. preAssemblerExecuter will be called with the source file.
2. Create a new file to write to.
3. Read the source file line by line.
4. If the line is EOF - go to step 6.
5. After each line is read the function will do the following:
    a. Clean the line from white spaces using "cleanLine" and return the cleaned line.
    b. Check if the line is a macro call or macro declaration.
    c. If the line isn't a macro call or macro declaration - copy the line to the new file using "copyLineToFile" and return to step 3.
    d. If the line is a macro call - replace the macro call with the macro's definition using "replaceMacroCall" and return to step 3.
    e. If the line is a macro declaration - check if the macro's name is valid using "isValidMacroName" and add the macro to the macros linked list using "saveMacroToList" and return to step 3.
    f. If the line is a comment (starts with ';') - ignore the line and return to step 3.
6. Free the memory and close the files.
