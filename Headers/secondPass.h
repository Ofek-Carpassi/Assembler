Algorithm:
1. Initialize IC (Instruction Counter) to 0.
2. Read a line from the input file - if the input has ended, go to step 9.
3. If the first field is a label, ignore it.
4. Is it a .data, .string or .extern? If so, go to step 2.
5. Is it a .entry? If so go to step 9.
6. In the operation table, put the right label in the .entry field. go to step 2.
7. Complete the operands translation according to the addressing method.
    If the operand contains a label, find it in the symbol table and code it to the memory.
8. Update IC by L. Go to step 2.
9. The input file was read, if there were any errors on the second pass, stop here.
10. Build the output files.

Algorithm - written codly so we know which functions we need to write:
1. Initialize IC (Instruction Counter) to 0.
2. Read a line from the input file - if the input has ended, go to step 8. (executeSecondPass - loops through the file)
3. Check if the first field is a label. (checkFieldLabel)
4. What it starts with? (checkStart) (if .data, .string or .extern go to step 2 - if .entry go to step 6)
5. In the operation table, put the right label in the .entry field. (handleEntry)
6. Complete the operands translation according to the addressing method. (translateOperands)
7. Update IC by L. Go to step 2. (continue the loop)
8. The input file was read, if there were any errors on the second pass, stop here.
9. Build the output files. (buildOutputFiles - another file).
